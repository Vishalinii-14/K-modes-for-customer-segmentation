# K-modes-for-customer-segmentation
A survey was conducted to know people's opinion on switching to electric vehicles.
It was obvious that various factors (place of residence, education and average travel per day) influence the decision of people.
To better understand the pattern, the customers are clustered using k-modes algorithm and popular opinion in each cluster is examined.
This helps to target specified customers for advertisement and improve marketing strategies.
